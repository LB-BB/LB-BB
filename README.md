### Hi, I'm LB. 

Pre-pandemic, I designed and built user experiences as an escape room creator. I earned my undergrad degree in sustainability and environmental studies.

I found the intersection of artistry and real-world problem-solving when I became a software engineer. After training in the Grace Hopper Program, I entered their Teaching Fellowship and am currently mentoring junior engineers.

I'm looking for a team that believes not only in their end product, but in ensuring the quality of the work from start to finish. As an escape room champ, I care a lot about details.

I have also seen 500 films. Let's discuss your favorite!
