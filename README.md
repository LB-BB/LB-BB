### Hi, I'm LB. 

I'm a former escape room creator, a current software developer, and a perpetual puzzle master.

I became interested in coding when I was in college studying environmental science. I found a website called Zooniverse that uses crowdsourcing to sort through complex data (like identifying animals in nature cams) that could take a researcher a lifetime to get through. Finding the site triggered a fascination with automating low-level work to free up experts' time. I joined the Grace Hopper program for Software Development at Fullstack Academy, and now I mentor junior engineers there.

During my time as a developer, unit testing has emerged as a crucial element that often gets overlooked until it becomes a crisis. I specialize in TDD with Mocha, and Iâ€™m looking for a team that invests in quality code.


I have also seen over 600 films. Let's discuss your favorite!
