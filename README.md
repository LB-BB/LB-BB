### Hi, I'm LB. 

Pre-pandemic, I designed and built user experiences in the form of live escape rooms. My early obsession, however, is environmental advocacy. I found the intersection of artistry and real-world problem-solving in software engineering. After training in the Grace Hopper Program, I am currently a Teaching Fellow at Fullstack Academy. 

It's my goal to find a team that believes not only in their end product, but in ensuring the quality of the work from start to finish. As a former escape room designer, I'm big on details.

I have also seen 500 films. Let's discuss your favorite!
